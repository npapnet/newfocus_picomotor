# newfocus_picomotor
This is a repository with code for Nwe focus Picomotors

This is repository created by N. Papadakis. 

These are modules and  classes used in a 2016 project at the Attosecond Laser Laboratory at IESL FORTH. 

They aim to use a New Focus 8752 Therenet controller to control a new focus picomotor using serial commands over an Ethernet connection.
